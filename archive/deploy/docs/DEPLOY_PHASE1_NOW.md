# Deploy Risk Per Trade Phase 1 - READY NOW

**Date:** April 2, 2026  
**Status:** ✅ READY TO DEPLOY  
**Risk Level:** LOW (No breaking changes)  
**Time Required:** 5 minutes

---

## What You're Deploying

Risk Management UI that allows users to:
- View their current risk percentage
- Change risk % (1%, 2%, 3%, 5%)
- Learn about risk management

**Important:** Risk % is saved but NOT yet used by trading engine (Phase 2). This is intentional for safety.

## Important Notes

### What Works:
✅ Users can view risk settings  
✅ Users can change risk %  
✅ Settings persist in database  
✅ Education and simulator work  
✅ UI is complete and functional

### What Doesn't Work Yet:
⏳ Risk % doesn't control position size  
⏳ Trading engine still uses fixed margin  
⏳ This is Phase 1 - UI only (intentional!)

### Why This Is Safe:
- No changes to trading logic
- Risk % is saved but not used yet
- Can't break existing functionality
- Easy to rollback if needed
- All tests passed (14/14)

---
