```

### Scanning Activity
All engines are actively scanning:
```
08:09:35 - [Signal] SOLUSDT no confluence — 1H=NEUTRAL, struct=uptrend
08:09:35 - [Signal] BNBUSDT ATR too low (0.26%) — market flat, skip
08:09:37 - [Signal] XRPUSDT ATR too low (0.34%) — market flat, skip
```

## What Changed

### Before Fix
When user switches trading mode:
- ❌ No startup notification sent
- ❌ User unsure if engine is running
- ❌ User unsure if scanning is active

### After Fix
When user switches trading mode:
- ✅ Startup notification sent with full config
- ✅ User sees engine is active
- ✅ User knows scanning has started
- ✅ User can verify via notification

## Notification Behavior

### Auto-Restore (Bot Restart)
- **Behavior**: `silent=True` (no notification)
- **Reason**: Avoid spamming users on every bot restart
- **Status**: ✅ Correct behavior

### Manual Start / Mode Switch
- **Behavior**: `silent=False` (send notification)
- **Reason**: User initiated action, needs confirmation
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed in this deployment

## Testing Verification

### Previous Live Test (Before This Deployment)
**User**: 1187119989
**Action**: Switched swing → scalping
**Time**: 06:50:27 UTC
**Result**: ✅ Notification sent, scanning started immediately

### Current Deployment
**Time**: 08:09:03 CEST
**Engines Restored**: 13
**Scanning Active**: ✅ Yes
**No Errors**: ✅ Confirmed

## Impact

### User Experience
- ✅ Clear feedback when switching modes
- ✅ Confidence that engine is running
- ✅ Transparency about configuration
- ✅ No confusion about scanning status

### System Stability
- ✅ No errors in logs
- ✅ All engines restored successfully
- ✅ Scanning continues normally
- ✅ No performance impact

## Next Steps

### For Users
1. Try switching trading mode (scalping ↔ swing)
2. Verify you receive startup notification
3. Confirm engine starts scanning immediately

### For Monitoring
1. Monitor VPS logs for mode switches
2. Verify notifications are sent
3. Confirm no errors occur

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If issues occur, rollback with:
```bash
# 1. SSH to VPS
ssh root@147.93.156.165

# 2. Restore from backup (if available)
cd /root/cryptomentor-bot/Bismillah/app/
cp trading_mode_manager.py.bak trading_mode_manager.py
cp scalping_engine.py.bak scalping_engine.py

# 3. Restart service
systemctl restart cryptomentor
```
