## Testing Plan

### Immediate Testing ⏳
1. Wait for next trade signal
2. Verify notification shows new text
3. Check user feedback

### TP Execution Testing ⏳
1. Wait for TP1 hit
2. Verify bot closes 50% automatically
3. Verify SL moves to breakeven
4. Verify TP1 hit notification sent

### Long-term Monitoring ⏳
1. Monitor user feedback over next 24 hours
2. Check if confusion about partial TP reduced
3. Verify no new issues introduced

---

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If any issues arise, rollback is simple:

```bash
# 1. Restore from backup (if created)
ssh root@147.93.156.165
cd /root/cryptomentor-bot
cp Bismillah/app/autotrade_engine.py.backup Bismillah/app/autotrade_engine.py
systemctl restart cryptomentor

# 2. Or re-deploy old version
scp Bismillah/app/autotrade_engine.py.old root@147.93.156.165:/root/cryptomentor-bot/Bismillah/app/autotrade_engine.py
ssh root@147.93.156.165 "systemctl restart cryptomentor"
```

Estimated rollback time: 2 minutes

2. Create video tutorial showing StackMentor
3. Monitor support tickets

### Long-term (Next Month)
1. Consider adding TP execution preview
2. Add real-time position tracking
3. Implement TP hit statistics
