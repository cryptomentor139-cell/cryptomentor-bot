## 🔧 Updates Applied - ALL 24 ENGINES

### Why All Engines Get Updates:

**Shared Codebase Architecture:**
- All users share the same Python files
- No per-user code customization
- Single deployment = all engines updated

**Files Updated:**
1. `Bismillah/app/autotrade_engine.py` - Used by ALL engines
2. `Bismillah/app/scheduler.py` - Used by ALL engines

**Deployment Method:**
```bash
# Single upload affects ALL users
scp autotrade_engine.py root@147.93.156.165:/root/cryptomentor-bot/Bismillah/app/
scp scheduler.py root@147.93.156.165:/root/cryptomentor-bot/Bismillah/app/

# Single restart applies to ALL engines
systemctl restart cryptomentor
```

## 🎯 Update Details

### 1. Exchange TP/SL Orders (Problem 1) ✅
**Status:** Applied to ALL 24 engines

**How it works:**
- Swing mode: Uses `place_order_with_tpsl()` in `autotrade_engine.py`
- Scalping mode: Uses `place_order_with_tpsl()` in `scalping_engine.py`
- Both modes share the same exchange client

**When it applies:**
- Active engines (14): On next trade ✅
- Stopped engines (10): When user starts them ✅

### 2. Risk Calculator Fix (Problem 2) ✅
**Status:** Applied to ALL 24 engines

**How it works:**
- Function `calc_qty_with_risk()` in `autotrade_engine.py`
- Called by both swing and scalping engines
- Calculates: Position Size = Risk Amount / SL Distance
- Validates: Margin Required = Position Value / Leverage

**When it applies:**
- Active engines (14): On next trade ✅
- Stopped engines (10): When user starts them ✅

### 3. No Auto-Restart for Stopped (Problem 3) ✅
**Status:** Applied to ALL 24 engines

**How it works:**
- Auto-restore query: Excludes "stopped" status (line 230)
- Health check query: Excludes "stopped" status (line 462)
- Stop button: Sets status to "stopped" (already correct)

**When it applies:**
- Active engines (14): Monitored by health check ✅
- Stopped engines (10): NOT monitored, NOT restored ✅

## 🔍 How to Verify Per-User

### Check if User's Engine is Running:
```bash
ssh root@147.93.156.165 "journalctl -u cryptomentor -f | grep 'user_id_here'"
```

### Check Risk Calculator Logs:
```bash
ssh root@147.93.156.165 "journalctl -u cryptomentor --since '1 hour ago' | grep RiskCalc"
```

### Check TP/SL Orders:
```bash
ssh root@147.93.156.165 "journalctl -u cryptomentor --since '1 hour ago' | grep place_order_with_tpsl"
```

### Check Auto-Restore Behavior:
```bash
ssh root@147.93.156.165 "journalctl -u cryptomentor --since '1 hour ago' | grep AutoRestore"
```
