# Maintenance Notification System - Complete Implementation

## Problem Statement

Users complained that engines are always inactive after VPS restart, reducing trading volume because users don't notice their engines are inactive.

## Root Cause

- Auto-restore exists but users don't notice when engines fail to restore
- No notification system to alert users about inactive engines after maintenance
- Users lose trading opportunities without realizing their engines are stopped

## Solution

Implemented a maintenance notification system that:
1. Runs automatically after bot restart
2. Detects all users with inactive engines
3. Sends friendly notifications in Bahasa Indonesia
4. Provides clear instructions to manually restart

## Implementation Details

### 1. New File: `Bismillah/app/maintenance_notifier.py`

**Function:** `send_maintenance_notifications(bot)`

**Logic:**
- Queries all sessions with status "active" or "uid_verified"
- Checks which engines are actually running using `is_running(user_id)`
- Identifies users with inactive engines
- Sends notification to each user with:
  - Explanation that bot just finished maintenance
  - Clear status: Engine is inactive
  - Instructions to restart: `/autotrade` → Start Engine
  - Warning that engine won't trade until manually activated

**Notification Message (Bahasa Indonesia):**
```
🔧 Pemberitahuan Maintenance

Bot baru saja selesai maintenance dan engine AutoTrade Anda saat ini tidak aktif.

📊 Status:
• Engine: Inactive
• Trading: Stopped

💡 Apa yang harus dilakukan?
Untuk melanjutkan trading, silakan aktifkan kembali engine Anda secara manual:

👉 Ketik: /autotrade

Kemudian pilih Start Engine untuk mengaktifkan kembali.

⚠️ Penting: Engine tidak akan trading sampai Anda mengaktifkannya kembali.
```

### 2. Modified: `Bismillah/app/scheduler.py`

**Integration Point:** After auto-restore completes, before stale position check

**Added Code:**
```python
# ── Send maintenance notifications to users with inactive engines ─
await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Wait for auto-restore to complete
try:
    from app.maintenance_notifier import send_maintenance_notifications
    await send_maintenance_notifications(application.bot)
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"[Maintenance] Failed to send notifications: {e}")
    import traceback
    traceback.print_exc()
```

**Execution Flow:**
1. Bot starts
2. Wait 3 seconds for bot to be fully ready
3. Auto-restore process runs (restores engines that can be restored)
4. Wait 2 seconds for auto-restore to complete
5. **Maintenance notifier runs** (notifies users with inactive engines)
6. Wait 5 seconds
7. Check stale positions
8. Start scheduler tasks

### 3. Test Script: `test_maintenance_notifier.py`

**Purpose:** Verify the notification system without actually sending messages

**Tests:**
- Query active sessions from database
- Check which engines are actually running
- Count inactive engines
- Display sample notification message
- Show summary statistics

**Run Test:**
```bash
cd /root/cryptomentor-bot
python test_maintenance_notifier.py
```

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Detection
- Runs once per bot restart
- No manual intervention needed
- Detects all inactive engines automatically

### 2. User-Friendly Notifications
- Written in Bahasa Indonesia
- Clear explanation of what happened
- Step-by-step instructions
- Non-alarming, helpful tone

### 3. Comprehensive Logging
- Logs all notification attempts
- Tracks success/failure rates
- Provides detailed summary

### 4. Error Handling
- Graceful failure handling
- Continues even if some notifications fail
- Logs all errors for debugging

## Benefits

### For Users:
- ✅ Immediate awareness of inactive engines
- ✅ Clear instructions to restart
- ✅ No lost trading opportunities
- ✅ Better user experience

### For Business:
- ✅ Increased trading volume
- ✅ Higher user engagement
- ✅ Reduced support tickets
- ✅ Better user retention

## Deployment

### Files to Deploy:
1. `Bismillah/app/maintenance_notifier.py` (new)
2. `Bismillah/app/scheduler.py` (modified)

### Deployment Commands:

```bash
# 1. Upload files to VPS
pscp -pw rMM2m63P Bismillah/app/maintenance_notifier.py root@147.93.156.165:/root/cryptomentor-bot/Bismillah/app/
pscp -pw rMM2m63P Bismillah/app/scheduler.py root@147.93.156.165:/root/cryptomentor-bot/Bismillah/app/

# 2. Clear Python cache
plink -pw rMM2m63P root@147.93.156.165 "cd /root/cryptomentor-bot && find . -type d -name __pycache__ -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null; find . -name '*.pyc' -delete"

# 3. Restart service
plink -pw rMM2m63P root@147.93.156.165 "systemctl restart cryptomentor.service"

# 4. Check logs
plink -pw rMM2m63P root@147.93.156.165 "journalctl -u cryptomentor.service -n 100 -f"
```

### Verification:

After deployment, check logs for:
```
[Maintenance] Checking for inactive engines...
[Maintenance] Found X sessions with active status
[Maintenance] Found Y users with inactive engines
[Maintenance] ✅ Notified user XXXXX
[Maintenance] Notification Summary:
  📤 Sent: X
  ❌ Failed: Y
  📊 Total inactive: Z
```

## Testing

### Local Test (Without Sending):
```bash
python test_maintenance_notifier.py
```

### VPS Test (After Deployment):
1. Restart the bot service
2. Check logs immediately after restart
3. Verify notifications were sent
4. Check with test users if they received notifications

## Expected Behavior

### Scenario 1: All Engines Restored Successfully
- Auto-restore: Restores all engines
- Maintenance notifier: Finds 0 inactive engines
- Result: No notifications sent
- Log: "All engines are running, no notifications needed"

### Scenario 2: Some Engines Failed to Restore
- Auto-restore: Restores some engines, some fail
- Maintenance notifier: Finds X inactive engines
- Result: X notifications sent
- Log: "Sent: X, Failed: 0, Total inactive: X"

### Scenario 3: User Manually Stopped Engine
- Auto-restore: Skips manually stopped engines
- Maintenance notifier: Detects inactive engine
- Result: User receives notification
- User action: Can choose to restart or keep stopped

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements:
1. Add "Quick Restart" button in notification
2. Track notification history to avoid duplicates
3. Add retry mechanism for failed notifications
4. Provide detailed failure reasons in notification
5. Add analytics dashboard for notification metrics

## Notes

- Notification runs ONCE per bot restart
- Does not repeatedly notify users
- Only notifies users with sessions marked as "active" or "uid_verified"
- Does not notify users who manually stopped their engines (status="stopped")
- Respects user privacy and preferences

## Support

If users report not receiving notifications:
1. Check logs for notification attempts
2. Verify user's session status in database
3. Check if user blocked the bot
4. Verify bot has permission to send messages

## Conclusion

This implementation solves the user complaint about inactive engines after VPS restart by:
- Automatically detecting inactive engines
- Sending clear, actionable notifications
- Providing step-by-step restart instructions
- Increasing user awareness and trading volume

The system is production-ready and can be deployed immediately.
