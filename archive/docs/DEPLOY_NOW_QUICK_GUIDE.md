# Deploy Risk Per Trade - Quick Guide

**Status:** ✅ READY TO DEPLOY  
**Risk Level:** LOW (No breaking changes)  
**Time Required:** 5 minutes  

---

## What You're Deploying

Risk management UI that lets users select their risk percentage (1%, 2%, 3%, 5%) instead of fixed margin. This phase is UI-only - the risk % is saved but not yet used by the trading engine.

## Important Notes

### What Works:
- ✅ Users can view risk settings
- ✅ Users can change risk %
- ✅ Settings persist
- ✅ Education and simulator work

### What Doesn't Work Yet:
- ⏳ Risk % doesn't control position size yet
- ⏳ Trading engine still uses fixed margin
- ⏳ This is Phase 1 - UI only

### Why This Is Safe:
- No changes to trading logic
- Risk % is saved but not used yet
- Can't break existing functionality
- Easy to rollback if needed

---

## Rollback (If Needed)

```bash
ssh root@147.93.156.165
cd /root/cryptomentor-bot/backups
ls -lt | head -5  # Find latest backup
cd risk_phase1_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
cp * /root/cryptomentor-bot/Bismillah/app/
systemctl restart cryptomentor.service
```

---

## Support

### If Service Won't Start:
```bash
# Check logs
ssh root@147.93.156.165 "journalctl -u cryptomentor.service -n 50"

# Check for Python errors
ssh root@147.93.156.165 "cd /root/cryptomentor-bot && python3 -m py_compile Bismillah/app/supabase_repo.py"
ssh root@147.93.156.165 "cd /root/cryptomentor-bot && python3 -m py_compile Bismillah/app/position_sizing.py"
ssh root@147.93.156.165 "cd /root/cryptomentor-bot && python3 -m py_compile Bismillah/app/handlers_autotrade.py"
```

### If UI Doesn't Show:
1. Check if files uploaded correctly
2. Verify service restarted
3. Check logs for errors
4. Try `/start` command in bot to refresh
