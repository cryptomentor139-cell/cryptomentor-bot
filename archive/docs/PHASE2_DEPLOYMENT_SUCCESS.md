```

### ✅ Step 2: Files Uploaded
```
✅ autotrade_engine.py (85KB) - Uploaded successfully
✅ scalping_engine.py (37KB) - Uploaded successfully
```

✅ scalping_engine.py - Contains used_risk_sizing
```

### ✅ Step 4: Service Restarted
```
✅ cryptomentor.service restarted successfully
✅ Service status: active (running)
✅ PID: 55520
✅ Memory: 91.7M
```

### ✅ Step 5: Initial Check
```

✅ Signal scanning active
```

---

## What Changed

### Before Deployment (Fixed Margin):
- User sets $10 capital
- Every trade uses $10 * leverage
- No compounding

### After Deployment (Risk-Based):
- User sets 2% risk (default)
- Position size varies by SL distance
- Automatic compounding as balance grows

---

## Current Status

**Service Status:** ✅ Running  
**Errors:** None  
**Risk Sizing:** Ready (will activate on next trade)  
**Fallback:** Available if needed

---

## Monitoring Plan

### Next 24 Hours - CRITICAL:

**Watch for:**
1. First trade with risk-based sizing
2. Position sizes calculated correctly
3. No fallback messages
4. No errors
5. Trades execute successfully

**Monitoring Commands:**

```bash
# Live logs with risk sizing filter
ssh root@147.93.156.165 "journalctl -u cryptomentor.service -f | grep -i 'risksizing\|fallback\|error'"

# Check recent risk sizing logs
ssh root@147.93.156.165 "journalctl -u cryptomentor.service -n 100 | grep RiskSizing"

# Check for fallback usage
ssh root@147.93.156.165 "journalctl -u cryptomentor.service -n 100 | grep FALLBACK"

# Service status
ssh root@147.93.156.165 "systemctl status cryptomentor.service"
```

---

## Expected Behavior

### When Next Trade Executes:

**Good Signs (Risk-Based Sizing Working):**
```
[RiskSizing:123456] BTCUSDT - Balance=$100.00, Risk=2%, Entry=$50000.00, SL=$49000.00, SL_Dist=2.00%, Position=$100.00, Margin=$10.00, Qty=0.002, Risk_Amt=$2.00
[Engine:123456] Using RISK-BASED position sizing for BTCUSDT
```

**Warning Signs (Fallback Used):**
```
[RiskSizing:123456] FAILED: ... - Falling back to fixed margin system
[Engine:123456] Using FIXED MARGIN position sizing for BTCUSDT (fallback)
```

---

## Rollback Procedure (If Needed)

**If critical issues found:**

```bash
# 1. Stop service
ssh root@147.93.156.165 "systemctl stop cryptomentor.service"

# 2. Restore backups
ssh root@147.93.156.165 "
cd /root/cryptomentor-bot/Bismillah/app
cp autotrade_engine.py.phase2_backup_20260402_181259 autotrade_engine.py
cp scalping_engine.py.phase2_backup_20260402_181259 scalping_engine.py
"

# 3. Restart service
ssh root@147.93.156.165 "systemctl start cryptomentor.service"
```
