# Engine Restore Fix - Complete

## Issue
Bot had redundant engine restore call in `bot.py` causing import error warning:
```
⚠️ Engine restore failed: No module named 'app.engine_restore'
```

However, engines were still being restored successfully via `scheduler.py`.

## Root Cause
Two restore mechanisms were in place:
1. **scheduler.py** (lines ~120-180): Working correctly, called via `start_scheduler()`
2. **bot.py** (lines 870-878): Redundant call with wrong import path

The redundant call in `bot.py` was failing but not affecting functionality since `scheduler.py` already handled restore.

## Solution
Removed redundant restore call from `bot.py` and added comment explaining that restore is handled by scheduler.

## Changes Made
**File**: `Bismillah/bot.py`
- Removed lines 870-878 (redundant restore_all_engines call)
- Added comment: "Note: Engine restore is handled by scheduler.start_scheduler() above"

## Verification
Deployed at **14:20 CEST** on April 3, 2026

### Restore Results:
```
[AutoTrade] Found 11 active sessions to restore
[AutoTrade] Restore complete: 11 restored, 0 failed
```

### Engine Status:
- ✅ 10 engines in SCALPING mode (5M timeframe, max 4 positions)
- ✅ 1 engine in SWING mode (manual mode user)
- ✅ All engines actively scanning 10 pairs
- ✅ No import errors
- ✅ Bot responding instantly (getUpdates every 1-3s)

### Users Restored:
1. 801937545 - SCALPING (30 USDT, 10x)
2. 1766523174 - SCALPING (15 USDT, 10x)
3. 7582955848 - SCALPING (10 USDT, 10x)
4. 8030312242 - SCALPING (10 USDT, 20x)
5. 6954315669 - SCALPING (14.5 USDT, 5x)
6. 5874734020 - SCALPING (10 USDT, 5x)
7. 312485564 - SCALPING (15 USDT, 20x)
8. 985106924 - SCALPING (25 USDT, 20x)
9. 8429733088 - SWING (25 USDT, 50x) - manual mode
10. 1306878013 - SCALPING (18 USDT, 10x)
11. 7338184122 - SCALPING (10 USDT, 5x)

## Impact
- ✅ Engines stay active after bot restart
- ✅ Trading volume maintained for admin
- ✅ No more import error warnings
- ✅ Clean startup logs
- ✅ Bot performance optimal (no lag)

## Technical Details
The restore mechanism in `scheduler.py` includes:
- Migration to risk-based mode (2% default risk)
- Setting scalping mode for max 4 concurrent positions
- Proper error handling and user notifications
- Silent restore (no startup notification spam)

All engines are now properly restored on every bot restart, ensuring continuous trading volume.
