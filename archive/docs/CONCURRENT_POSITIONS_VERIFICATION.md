## How Concurrent Positions Work

### Scalping Mode (5M Timeframe)

**Max Positions:** 4 concurrent positions

**Example Scenario:**
```
User balance: $1,000
Risk per trade: 2%

Position 1: BTCUSDT LONG - Risk $20
Position 2: ETHUSDT SHORT - Risk $20
Position 3: SOLUSDT LONG - Risk $20
Position 4: BNBUSDT LONG - Risk $20

Total Risk Exposure: $80 (8% of balance)
```

**Position Lifecycle:**
1. Engine scans 10 pairs every 15 seconds
2. Finds high-confidence signal (>80%)
3. Checks: `len(self.positions) < 4`
4. If space available: Opens position
5. If 4 positions active: Waits for one to close
6. Max hold time: 30 minutes (auto-close)
7. Cooldown: 5 minutes before re-entering same pair

### Swing Mode (15M Timeframe)

**Max Positions:** 4 concurrent positions

**Example Scenario:**
```
User balance: $1,000
Risk per trade: 2%

Position 1: BTCUSDT LONG - Risk $20 (StackMentor 3-tier TP)
Position 2: ETHUSDT LONG - Risk $20 (StackMentor 3-tier TP)
Position 3: SOLUSDT SHORT - Risk $20 (StackMentor 3-tier TP)
Position 4: XRPUSDT LONG - Risk $20 (StackMentor 3-tier TP)

Total Risk Exposure: $80 (8% of balance)
```

**Position Lifecycle:**
1. Engine scans 10 pairs every 45 seconds
2. Finds high-confidence signal (>68%)
3. Checks: `len(open_positions) < 4`
4. If space available: Opens position with StackMentor
5. If 4 positions active: Waits for one to close
6. StackMentor: Partial closes at TP1 (50%), TP2 (40%), TP3 (10%)
7. Breakeven: SL moves to entry after TP1 hit

## Risk Management

### Total Exposure Calculation

**Formula:**
```
Total Risk Exposure = Risk per Trade × Number of Positions
```

**Examples:**

**Conservative (1% risk, 4 positions):**
```
Balance: $1,000
Risk per trade: 1%
Max positions: 4

Total exposure: 1% × 4 = 4%
Max loss: $40
Survivability: 25+ consecutive losses
```

**Standard (2% risk, 4 positions):**
```
Balance: $1,000
Risk per trade: 2%
Max positions: 4

Total exposure: 2% × 4 = 8%
Max loss: $80
Survivability: 12+ consecutive losses
```

**Aggressive (3% risk, 4 positions):**
```
Balance: $1,000
Risk per trade: 3%
Max positions: 4

Total exposure: 3% × 4 = 12%
Max loss: $120
Survivability: 8+ consecutive losses
```

### Circuit Breaker

**Daily Loss Limit:** 5% of balance

Both modes have circuit breaker that stops trading if daily loss reaches 5%:
```python
if daily_pnl_usdt <= -daily_loss_limit:
    logger.warning(f"Daily loss limit hit ({daily_pnl_usdt:.2f} USDT)")
    # Stop trading until tomorrow
```

This protects against:
- Extreme market volatility
- Multiple losing trades in a row
- System errors causing repeated losses

## User Guide

### How to Check Your Mode

1. Open bot: `/autotrade`
2. Check dashboard:
   - ⚡ = Scalping mode (5M)
   - 📊 = Swing mode (15M)

### How to Switch Modes

1. Stop engine if running
2. Go to Settings → Trading Mode
3. Select desired mode
4. Start engine

### Monitoring Concurrent Positions

**In Bot:**
- Dashboard shows active positions
- Each position listed with symbol, side, PnL

**On Exchange:**
- Check Bitunix Futures → Positions
- Should see up to 4 open positions
- Each with separate TP/SL

---

## Recommendations

### For Small Accounts ($50-$500)

**Recommended:**
- Mode: Scalping (faster turnover)
- Risk: 1-2% per trade
- Max positions: 2-3 (not full 4)
- Reason: Lower total exposure, easier to manage

### For Medium Accounts ($500-$5,000)

**Recommended:**
- Mode: Either (test both)
- Risk: 2% per trade
- Max positions: 4 (full capacity)
- Reason: Balanced risk/reward, good diversification

### For Large Accounts ($5,000+)

**Recommended:**
- Mode: Swing (better for size)
- Risk: 1-2% per trade
- Max positions: 4 (full capacity)
- Reason: StackMentor 3-tier TP, better for larger positions

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Why am I only getting 1 position?"

**Possible causes:**
1. **No other signals:** Market conditions not favorable
2. **Cooldown active:** Recently traded same pair (scalping only)
3. **Confidence too low:** Signals below threshold
4. **Daily loss limit:** Circuit breaker triggered

**Solution:** Wait for better market conditions

### "Can I increase to more than 4 positions?"

**Not recommended:**
- 4 positions = 8% total exposure (with 2% risk)
- More positions = higher risk
- Circuit breaker at 5% daily loss
- Could hit limit faster with more positions

**If you insist:**
- Edit `max_concurrent_positions` in code
- Understand the increased risk
- Monitor closely
