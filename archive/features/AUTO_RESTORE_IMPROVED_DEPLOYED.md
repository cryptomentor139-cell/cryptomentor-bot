# Auto-Restore Improved & Health Check Deployed ✅

**Deployment Time:** April 4, 2026 05:59 CEST  
**Status:** ✅ SUCCESS - All engines auto-restored

---

## Problem Solved

**Issue:** User complained that some engines need manual restart after VPS reboot even though they were active before.

**Root Cause:**
1. Auto-restore only queried `status = "active"`, missing users with `status = "uid_verified"`
2. No health check to detect and restart dead engines
3. Silent failures - errors not logged properly
4. Forced all users to scalping mode, ignoring their preference

---

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. ✅ Improved Auto-Restore Logic

**Changes:**
- Query BOTH `status = "active"` AND `status = "uid_verified"`
- Preserve user's trading mode preference (don't force scalping)
- Better error logging with full traceback
- Detailed restoration summary
- Send notification to ALL restored users

**Before:**
```python
res = _client().table("autotrade_sessions").select("*").eq("status", "active").execute()
# Only gets "active" status
# Forces scalping mode on everyone
# Silent=True (no notification)
```

**After:**
```python
res = _client().table("autotrade_sessions").select("*").in_(
    "status", ["active", "uid_verified"]
).execute()
# Gets BOTH statuses
# Preserves user's trading mode
# Silent=False (sends notification)
# Full error logging with traceback
```

### 2. ✅ Added Engine Health Check

**New Feature:** Periodic health check every 5 minutes

**How It Works:**
1. Every 5 minutes, check all sessions that should be running
2. Detect engines that stopped unexpectedly
3. Auto-restart dead engines
4. Notify users of auto-restart
5. If restart fails, notify user to restart manually

**Benefits:**
- Engines auto-recover from crashes
- Users don't need to manually restart
- Admin gets visibility into engine health
- Reduces downtime

**Code:**
```python
async def _engine_health_check_task(application):
    """Check every 5 minutes if engines are still alive"""
    while True:
        await asyncio.sleep(300)  # 5 minutes
        
        # Get all active sessions
        sessions = get_active_sessions()
        
        # Check each engine
        for session in sessions:
            if not is_running(user_id):
                # Engine is dead! Restart it
                restart_engine(user_id)
                notify_user("Engine auto-restarted")
```

### 3. ✅ Better Logging

**Added:**
- Restoration summary with counts
- Failed user list
- Full error tracebacks
- Health check status logs

**Example Output:**
```
================================================================================
[AutoRestore] Restoration Summary:
  ✅ Restored: 13
  ⏭️  Skipped (already running): 0
  ❌ Failed: 0
  📊 Total sessions: 13
================================================================================
```

### 4. ✅ User Notifications

**All restored users now receive:**
```
🔄 AutoTrade Engine Auto-Restored

✅ Your engine was automatically restarted after server maintenance

📊 Current Settings:
• Mode: Scalping
• Capital: 15 USDT
• Leverage: 10x
• Risk Management: Active

💡 Your engine is now monitoring the market and will trade automatically.

Use /autotrade to check status or adjust settings.
```

## Health Check Details

### Check Interval:
- **Frequency:** Every 5 minutes
- **First check:** 5 minutes after bot starts
- **Continuous:** Runs forever in background

### What It Checks:
1. Query all sessions with status "active" or "uid_verified"
2. For each session, check if engine is running
3. If engine should be running but isn't → DEAD
4. Attempt auto-restart
5. Notify user of restart (success or failure)

### Auto-Restart Process:
```
1. Detect dead engine
2. Get user's API keys
3. Get session settings (capital, leverage, mode)
4. Start engine with saved settings
5. Send notification to user
6. Log result
```

### Notifications:

**Success:**
```
🔄 AutoTrade Engine Auto-Restarted

Your engine stopped unexpectedly and has been automatically restarted.

📊 Mode: Scalping
💰 Capital: 15 USDT

If this happens frequently, please contact support.

Use /autotrade to check status.
```

**Failure:**
```

Your engine stopped and auto-restart failed.

Please restart manually: /autotrade
```
