## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

After investigating the codebase and logs, I found the main cause:

### 1. Demo User Balance Limit Check (PRIMARY CAUSE)
**Location:** `Bismillah/app/autotrade_engine.py` line 989-1014

**Problem:**
- Demo users have a $50 balance limit
- Engine checks balance every scan cycle
- If balance > $50, engine stops automatically
- No buffer for small fluctuations

**Demo Users:**
- 1227424284
- 801937545
- 5765813002
- 1165553495
- 6735618958

### 2. Potential Causes (Not Found in This Case)
- Daily loss limit exceeded
- API key validation failure
- Manual stop by user
- Trading mode switch

## 🔧 Fix Applied

### Changed Balance Check Logic

**Before:**
```python
if total_balance > DEMO_BALANCE_LIMIT:  # Stops at $50.01
    stop_engine(user_id)
    return
```

**After:**
```python
# Only stop if balance significantly exceeds limit (10% buffer)
if total_balance > (DEMO_BALANCE_LIMIT * 1.1):  # Stops at $55.00
    stop_engine(user_id)
    logger.info(f"[Engine:{user_id}] Demo user stopped: balance ${total_balance:.2f} > ${DEMO_BALANCE_LIMIT:.0f}")
    return
```

### Improvements:
1. ✅ Added 10% buffer ($5) before stopping
2. ✅ Added logging when demo user engine stops
3. ✅ Added error logging for balance check failures
4. ✅ Prevents premature stops due to small PnL fluctuations

## 📊 Impact

### Before Fix:
- Engine stops at $50.01 balance
- No warning or logging
- User confused why engine keeps stopping
- Silent failures

### After Fix:
- Engine stops at $55.00 balance
- Clear logging of stop reason
- 10% buffer for normal trading fluctuations
- Better user experience

## 🎯 For User bhax10

### If You Are a Demo User:
Your engine was stopping because your balance exceeded $50. Now you have a $55 limit with better logging.

**To check if you're a demo user:**
1. Open bot
2. Type `/autotrade`
3. Check your balance
4. If balance is near $50-55, you're likely a demo user

**To increase limit:**
Contact @yongdnf3 to upgrade from demo account

### If You Are NOT a Demo User:
The fix still helps by:
- Better error logging
- More stable engine operation
- Clear stop reasons in logs

## 🔍 How to Verify Fix

### For Admins:
```bash
# Check logs for demo user stops
ssh root@147.93.156.165 "journalctl -u cryptomentor --since '1 hour ago' | grep 'Demo user stopped'"

# Check if engine is running for specific user
ssh root@147.93.156.165 "journalctl -u cryptomentor --since '1 hour ago' | grep 'USER_ID'"
```

### For Users:
1. Activate engine via `/autotrade`
2. Wait 5-10 minutes
3. Check status again
4. Engine should stay active (unless balance > $55 for demo users)

## 📝 Additional Notes

### Other Reasons Engine Might Stop:

1. **Daily Loss Limit (5%)**
   - Engine stops if you lose 5% of balance in one day
   - Resets at midnight UTC
   - Safety feature to prevent large losses

2. **API Key Issues**
   - Invalid API key
   - Expired API key
   - Insufficient permissions

3. **Manual Stop**
   - User clicked "Stop Engine" button
   - Admin stopped engine

4. **Trading Mode Switch**
   - Switching between Scalping/Swing modes
   - Engine restarts automatically after switch
